In December, ending the year 2023, We CSpace participated in various contests.<br><br>

On December 15, at the "SPARK!TOHOKU 2023 Startup Pitch", a pitch event for innovative technology and services among ICT startups in Tohoku, we received the ï¼»EO North Japan Awardï¼½!  ðŸŽ‰ During the presentations and also during the later public mentoring sessions, there were valuable insights from everyone who are actively engaged in the forefront of the ICT field. It was a highly productive duration. <br><br>

Furthermore, we also participated in the Tohoku University Business Idea Contest 2023, an event held on Dec 16th at Tohoku University Aobayama Commons. We are thrilled to share that we bagged the ï¼»NTT Data Awardï¼½ and the ï¼»Audience Awardï¼½! ðŸŽ‰ This journey has been a source of inspiration, uncovering new perspectives and approaches. It was exciting to compete alongside with the eight finalists who tackled societal challenges with creativity and innovation.<br><br> 

With the support of everyone who cheered us on, the insightful judges, generous sponsors, and the amazing organizers, we're ready to take CSpace to the next level! Thanks for the encouragement and feedback. <br><br>

In 2024, we will further devote ourselves to make it a year of significant growth for CSpace. We appreciate your ongoing support. Thank you!<br><br>
